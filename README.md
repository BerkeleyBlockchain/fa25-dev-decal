# Welcome to the Blockchain for Developers Decal!

This decal is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of relevant topics in blockchain development, as well as hands-on experience in developing and deploying their own smart contracts & sovereign Cosmos blockchains.

Blockchain is currently one of the fastest-growing industries in the technology sector. In response to this shortage of blockchain developers, this course aims to teach students the technical fundamentals of blockchains, the Solidity programming language, the Cosmos ecosystem, as well as industry-relevant tools such as Metamask, Wagmi, Foundry, Rust, and Cosmos SDK such that students will be equipped with industry-relevant experience in an accessible, collaborative environment. We hope that through this course, students will become more confident in their ability to develop and deploy blockchain-based solutions on important industry issues.
