# Welcome to the Blockchain for Developers Decal!

This decal is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of relevant topics in blockchain development, as well as hands-on experience in developing and deploying their own smart contracts & sovereign Cosmos blockchains.

Blockchain is currently one of the fastest-growing industries in the technology sector. In response to this shortage of blockchain developers, this course aims to teach students the technical fundamentals of blockchains, the Solidity programming language, the Cosmos ecosystem, as well as industry-relevant tools such as Metamask, Wagmi, Foundry, Rust, and Cosmos SDK such that students will be equipped with industry-relevant experience in an accessible, collaborative environment. We hope that through this course, students will become more confident in their ability to develop and deploy blockchain-based solutions on important industry issues.

## Weekly Lecture Topics/YouTube Videos
### Week 1
But How Does BitCoin Actually Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4 - Great video on Bitcoin's underlying structure. Worth the watch.

Blockchain 101 - A Visual Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8 - Good video for understanding how nonce values are found for Bitcoin block headers + how blocks link together to form a "block-chain".

### Week 2
#### Topic Preview
Development & Ecosystem Tools:
Metamask: Crypto wallet for Ethereum and any other EVM compatible chain.
Etherscan: Block explorer for Ethereum. View and verify transactions, addresses, smart contracts, tokens, and blocks on Ethereum
Foundry: Development framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Helps developers write, test, deploy, and interact with contracts
Remix IDE: Online IDE for writing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts. No installation needed!

Networks & Infrastructure:
Testnets (Test Networks): Versions of Ethereum that behave like the real chain but use valueless test ETH. They let developers deploy, test, and debug smart contracts or dApps without risking real money.
RPC (Remote Procedure Call): The “bridge” (URL endpoint) your wallet/dApp uses to connect to a blockchain network (mainnet, testnet, or another chain)

Solidity:
A Headstart on Solidity programming language: Crypto Zombies is an interactive game that teaches you how to write Solidity smart contracts by making your own zombie NFT! Great way to get familiar with Solidity :)
